# Blog.Project
This project involves creating a personal blog website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to design an engaging, user-friendly platform for sharing writing and interests. The website will include a home page displaying recent blog posts and categories, allowing visitors to easily navigate and explore different topics.

Each blog post will have its own individual page with a unique URL, featuring the full content, title, date, and author information. Additionally, posts will have a comment section to encourage reader interaction and discussion.

A search function will be implemented to allow users to search for specific posts by title, content, or keywords. The site will also be designed with responsive layout and styling to ensure a seamless browsing experience across various devices and screen sizes.

Further features may include an about page for introducing the author, a contact page with a form for user inquiries, and social media integration for sharing posts. The project aims to demonstrate web development skills and provide an effective platform for content creation and audience engagement.
